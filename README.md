The Face Recognition Based Attendance System is an automated attendance tracking application built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and MySQL. Instead of taking attendance manually, this system uses advanced face recognition technology to identify students in real time through a webcam or camera feed and automatically logs their attendance in the database. This saves time, eliminates errors, and ensures a reliable attendance record.

The system provides a secure Admin Panel where administrators or teachers can manage student profiles, train the face recognition model, and review attendance records with intuitive dashboards and reports. The model is trained using the students’ face images, and every time a student appears in front of the camera, the system recognizes the face and marks them as present.

A key enhancement in this system is the Low Attendance Email Alert Feature. The system continuously calculates attendance percentages for all students and, if a student’s attendance falls below a predefined threshold (for example 75%), it automatically sends them an email warning about their low attendance. This email alert is generated using SMTP (such as Gmail or institutional email) and contains a personalized message that notifies the student about their current attendance percentage and urges them to improve before it affects their academic standing.

Administrators can configure the attendance threshold, schedule automatic checks, and view sent alerts within the admin dashboard. Overall, this project integrates computer vision for real-time recognition, backend logic for attendance management, and automated communication to improve student accountability, making it a comprehensive attendance solution for educational institutions.
